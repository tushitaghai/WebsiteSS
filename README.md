# WebsiteSS

I have developed two web-pages- Index and Dashb. Index is a login page, which takes you to Dashb which is a dashboard showing some company figures and charts. While index.html and dashb.html provided the structure of my webpages, style1.css and style2.css have given some styling to the pages. Finally login.js is a javascript file which contains a function to help validate the login credentials of any user for the Login page (index.html).

Time taken to complete this was 5 hours (with breaks).
